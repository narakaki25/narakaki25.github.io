The last WOD we did before this essay is due was Invoice 1. In invoice 1 we had to create an invoice table with five products and their respective prices and quantities and then calculate the totals. https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html Click here for more detials. What I felt worked well for me on this WOD was assigning the variables. Needless to say that this was the easiest part of the WOD but especially the totals where it made more sense to add the variables together rather than hard coding in the number I felt like I caught on to that very fast. For what didn't work so well for me I think that the string expressiosn gave me some trouble. I didn't know where to start with the expressions so I ended up having to search them up myself but eventually I figured them out and after that it was smooth sailing. What I did to prepare for this WOD was to read all the instructions first and to write notes down on what I thought I would have to do for each step. I usually do this for every WOD so this is no different. What I think I should do for next time I do a WOD is to try and look into the steps I'm unsure about a little more either by rereading the material or finding web resources.
