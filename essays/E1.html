  <p>I had some idea on how to start Browser History 1 but then I hit a wall on how to link to the internal sections in the table of contents so I did some research on how to do that and then I did the WOD again. It took me two tires to complete Browser History 1. I also had some diffficulties with operating my recording software so that contributed to the second try. It took me around 30 minutes to finish Browser History 1. For Browser History 2 I had some difficulty on linking the stylesheet to the main html so I had to do some research. I also had some trouble linking the google fonts as well so I ended up having to try another attempt. It took me around 30 minutes to finish Browser History 2. For Browser History 3 I had some trouble with the padding of the middle column and it lining up with the other two but I eventually figured it out and I also had trouble with the div tags and the ids with linking them in the css but I looked up how to do that as well. It took me around 25-30 minutes to complete Browser Histroy 3.</p>
